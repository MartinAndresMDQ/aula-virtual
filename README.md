# Aula virtual

> Aula virtual is a collaborative teaching platform. If you are a teacher, just create a new classroom and let students join. Everything you do will be shared to others. You are in control, but you can grant privileges to any student in your classroom. 
> 
> **Remember, it's just a proof of concept, not ready for production!**
